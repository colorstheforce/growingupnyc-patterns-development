The Alert Banner Object is a fixed container that contains a string, notifying the user of temporary information about programs, events, etc. A cookie for the notification is created when a user closes the object. The alert will therefore not expire until the cookie has expired, based on the number of days you set, if you did not specify the number of days through an argument to the ***alertBanner()*** class, the cookie expiration date with be defaulted to  360 days.
